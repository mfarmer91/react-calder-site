  <p>Love for Alexander Calder began at kinetic.  Calder Associates Inc. founder Michael Farmer experienced his first mobile — movable drawing in space — at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia at 10 years old.  Fast-forward 15 years, and Michael has dedicated both academic study and 6 years art world employment to gaining an unparalleled expertise in Calder’s works.</p>
   <p>Calder Associates Inc. offers certified authentication, in-depth price evaluation and international private sale of all Alexander Calder works.  In addition, a global network of renowned art-world connections — including museums, conservationists, collectors and auction houses — are at the disposal of any Calder Associates Inc. client.  Calder works move, and so does Calder’s market.  We know both.</p>
